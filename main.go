/* TODO
Minimum project
- two player
- console boards (yours and radar)
- player switching
Extra
- two player with computer player.
- if a hit is found by computer.
- check in points around the hit until sunk.
- save state

------ TODO
DONE Finish planing doc
DONE Install go-lang build / run hello world. Set up git repro.
Set up boards, 2 for each user (player board, radar). Allow player modification and print them all out.
Get clean print out of boards, allow switching between players boards.
UI â€“ start menu
Ship placement and storage, sinking, display hits, missus, etc.
Clean implement all rules and game over checks.
Start computer player if time, if not work on fixing bugs and finishing minimum requirements.
Find good algorithms used by battleship players for the computer.
More computer player work and clean up, QA
Fill out document, make video final clean up and formfitting.
